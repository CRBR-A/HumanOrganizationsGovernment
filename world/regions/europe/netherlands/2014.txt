| Flag description: | three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and blue; similar to the flag of Luxembourg, which uses a lighter blue and is longer; the colors were those of WILLIAM I, Prince of Orange, who led the Dutch Revolt against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the 16th century; originally the upper band was orange, but because it tended to fade to red over time, the red shade was eventually made the permanent color; the banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in continuous use |
| National symbol(s): | lion |
| National anthem: | name: "Het Wilhelmus" (The William) |
| National anthem: | lyrics/music: Philips VAN MARNIX van Sint Aldegonde (presumed)/unknown |
